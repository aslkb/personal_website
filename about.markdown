A little bit about myself:

I did my highschool at Tehnical-Humanitarian Lyceum, passed with 4.86 GPA, unfortenately, without dinstiction (but who cares?)

My first interest to computers started when i was 11 years old with hardware.

One of the biggest accomplishments so far is to win AGSSA aka DP (Dövlət Programmı) to study at Sabanci University, but decided to reject it. Now, i would try to reapply to better universities across the world.
